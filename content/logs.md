title: "Daily log"

Here is a daily log of my work and learning. The sole goal of this log is to keep track of my progress and to keep me accountable. I will try to keep it as short as possible.

## 2022
### September
#### 29
* Quick reading and set up of this hugo blog
* finished sprint 2 around going deep on some defi protocols. Looking for the next project to work on
* worked on my backlog of projects
#### 30
* working on a sandwich attack detector
* checked [mev-inspect-py](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-py/blob/main/mev_inspect/sandwiches.py): understand how to classify a sandwich attack 
* drafted an naive approach to detect sandwich attacks with a tx as an input
### October
#### 03
* worked on the implementation of the draft
* currently able to parse/filter/order swap tx coming from a specific dex. By manually testing it, it seems to work fine. And I was actually able to detect some sandwich attacks by the logs I am getting.
* Multi hop support is working fine (In case of A -> B -> C swap, adding A -> B as 1 swap and B -> C as another swap).
* Multi hop swaps are transiting through the Pair first, which is explaining why mev-inspect-py is filtering this case out. 
#### 04
* implemented the approach to detect sandwich attacks in a block
* read and tried to implemented a library with typescript.
* Currently messing with the tsconfig.json to make it work with the library
#### 05
* After few attempts, I was able to make it work but with some workaround command.
* After taking a close look to uniswap v3 sdk, it looks like they are using tsdx to build their library. This thing is working perfectly well.
* Defined sandwich detection logic for a specific address
* Worked on the implementation of the logic which is implying to get all the tx from an address. Interestingly enough, nodes cannot return all the tx from an address. 
* Integrated with Covalent api to get all the tx from an address and will finish the rest of the logic tomorrow
#### 06
* fixing an issue with the sandwich detection logic
* finished the implementation of the sandwich detection logic for addresses but rpc is hitting the rate limit + logic very messy. Also Uniswap v2 is not showing a lot of attacks
* Trying to understand the classification logic made in mev-inspect-py. Fail to run it as it requires an RPC with support for OpenEthereum / Erigon traces.
#### 07
* Traces might add to much complexity to the project. Most probably not worth it for now
* Massive refactoring of the code. Still missing testing.
* Trying to make the RPC call robuster using a home-made retryable provider
* Missing: check the swap creation, unit tests, CI/CD, documentation/Readme, Front-end?, article
#### 08
* Came up with a light approach: considering that most of the sandwiches are happening at  n-1 and n+1, instead of calling the RPC to get the details of all the tx in a block, we could simply take the tx at n-1 and n+1 and check if they are sandwich attacks.
* Done the implementation of the light approach by generalizing to n (so it will fetch n before and after the swap from the address). Giving better result in robustness and performance. Up to 2 it is working well. Will test it more tomorrow.
#### 09
* Starting testing
* Got to read about mocking in jest (see [article](https://medium.com/@davguij/mocking-typescript-classes-with-jest-8ef992170d1d))
#### 10
* Checked the finalist of ETHBogota hackathon [link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZbQO0esKzo)
* so far failing due to `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` in the testing. TSDX seems to have all the config don correctly. --> downgraded axios to 0.21.1 (not importing but exporting the module directly). If I got time, I will open an issue os TSDX side.
* Mocking TS classes is a mess with jest
#### 11
* Finished testing
* Added CI/CD
* Added documentation
#### 12
* Create a thread about sandwich-scanner on twitter
* Read [anatomy of a mev strategy from Bert Miller](https://bertcmiller.com/2021/09/05/mev-synthetix.html)
* Read [order flow](https://noxx.substack.com/p/order-flows-kingmaker-of-the-block) article from noxx. Order flow represents which actors and in what order are used to perform a tx (searcher order flow vs private order flow).
#### 13
* Wrote [first article on wrapper and retry logic for RPC calls](https://www.nogo.wtf/posts/make-your-rpc-calls-more-resilient/) üî•
* Re-priortized my backlog: chose one project to work on: next project will be salty and private 3Ô∏èüòà
* start rust learning with the [course from Rhymu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-qVNZ-zXL0&list=PLbtjxiXev6lpd331MW2dB7UgSIovgv169&index=1) ü¶Ä
#### 14
* Finished the serie from Rhymu. `& = borrow`
* In a sentence: rust is hard but worth to learn. A lot of very interesting concepts(Reference, Ownership, Borrowing, Lifetimes, Traits, Generics, etc...). Starting to work on the project decided will definitely help me to understand rust better. Even if, most probably, code will be a mess.
#### 15 - 16
* Rusting... (https://exercism.org/tracks/rust + RPL book reading)
