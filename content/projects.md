### Sandwich detector [WIP]
Sandwich detector is on-chain data analysis tool to detect sandwich attacks. 
As I wanted to learn about sdk development in typescript, the core detection logic will sit in a specific sdk package. It is a work in progress and is currently being developed in [this repo](https://github.com/0xnogo/sandwich-detector-sdk).
A backend and a frontend will be probably developped. 

Tech:
* sdk: Typescript, ethers.js
* ??Backend??: nodejs, express, mongodb
* Frontend: React, TailwindCSS, wagmi

### NFTLender
NFTLender is a playground nft-based lending protocol. In simple world, you can deposit your NFTs as collateral. Each NFT will weight based on the floor price of the collection. With that, borrow ETH from the protocol, reimburse your loans and get liquidated ðŸ¤‘.

Fun project to learn about DeFi and NFT and try out some cool projects (Foundry and wagmi.js).

Tech:
* Backend: Solidity, Foundry
* Frontend: React, TailwindCSS, wagmi

[Try it here](https://nftlender.vercel.app/) (no eth in the smart contract so impossible to borrow). Reach out to me if you want to have a try.
